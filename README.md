First upload for GeoCluster.

MultiPolygon boundaries of provinces, counties and (some) Dublin postal districts included.

NOTE: Dublin postal districts were drawn free-hand from Open Street Map in QGIS.

Province and county boundaries were sourced here: https://data.gov.ie/organization/ordnance-survey-ireland
